Basic COBOL Syntax
COBOL is column dependent. Looking for 5 key areas in a 72 column line.
Sequence Number Area(column 1-6) - Indicator Area(column 7) - A Area(column 8-11) - B Area(column 12-72) - Identification Area(column 73-80)

Identification area is where compiler isn't run. So most people leave it blank, can be used for comments possibly.

1. Columns 8-11 make up what section of a COBOL line of code?
A Area

2. What division of a COBOL program would you put your name in, if you wanted other programmers to see who created it?
